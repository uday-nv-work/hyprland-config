# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Hyprland window manager configuration repository based on JaKooLit's Hyprland-Dots. It contains a comprehensive setup with organized configuration files, scripts, and customization options for a modern Linux desktop environment.

## Architecture and Structure

### Core Configuration Files
- **hyprland.conf**: Main entry point that sources all other configuration files
- **monitors.conf**: Display/monitor configuration (managed by nwg-displays)
- **workspaces.conf**: Workspace configuration
- **hypridle.conf**: Idle daemon configuration
- **hyprlock.conf**: Screen lock configuration

### Configuration Organization
The configuration is modularly organized into several directories:

**configs/**: Default system configurations
- `Keybinds.conf`: Core keybindings (SUPER as main modifier)

**UserConfigs/**: User-customizable configurations (preserved during updates)
- `01-UserDefaults.conf`: Default applications and environment variables
- `UserSettings.conf`: Main Hyprland settings
- `UserKeybinds.conf`: Additional user keybindings
- `UserDecorations.conf`: Window decorations and visual settings
- `UserAnimations.conf`: Animation configurations
- `WindowRules.conf`: Window rules and layer rules
- `Startup_Apps.conf`: Applications to launch at startup
- `ENVariables.conf`: Environment variables

**scripts/**: System automation scripts (40+ utilities)
- Window management, screenshot tools, media controls, theming, brightness/volume controls
- All scripts are located in `$HOME/.config/hypr/scripts`

**UserScripts/**: User-added scripts (preserved during updates)
- Custom utilities like weather, wallpaper management, theme switching

### Key Features
- **Modular Configuration**: Each aspect (keybinds, decorations, animations) is in separate files
- **Update-Safe**: UserConfigs and UserScripts directories are preserved during system updates
- **Initial Boot Script**: `initial-boot.sh` runs once to set up theming, wallpapers, and system preferences
- **Monitor Profiles**: Support for multiple display configurations via Monitor_Profiles directory
- **Theme Integration**: Wallust for color scheme generation, GTK/Qt theming integration

### Default Applications
- Terminal: Ghostty (`$term = ghostty`)
- File Manager: Thunar (`$files = thunar`)
- Editor: Neovim (`EDITOR=nvim`)

### Key Navigation
- Main Modifier: `SUPER` key
- Window focus: SUPER + h/j/k/l (vim-style)
- Window movement: SUPER + CTRL + h/j/k/l
- Window resizing: SUPER + SHIFT + h/j/k/l
- Workspace switching: SUPER + [1-9,0]
- Smart launcher: SUPER + D (uses smart-launch.sh)

### Script Variables
Important path variables used throughout the configuration:
- `$scriptsDir = $HOME/.config/hypr/scripts`
- `$UserConfigs = $HOME/.config/hypr/UserConfigs`
- `$UserScripts = $HOME/.config/hypr/UserScripts`

## Development Guidelines

### Making Configuration Changes
1. **User configurations**: Edit files in `UserConfigs/` directory - these are preserved during updates
2. **Custom scripts**: Add new scripts to `UserScripts/` directory
3. **Monitor profiles**: Create display profiles in `Monitor_Profiles/` directory using nwg-displays
4. **Avoid modifying**: Core files in `configs/` and `scripts/` as these may be overwritten during updates

### Key Configuration Files to Customize
- `UserConfigs/01-UserDefaults.conf`: Change default terminal, file manager, editor
- `UserConfigs/UserKeybinds.conf`: Add custom keybindings without conflicting with defaults
- `UserConfigs/Startup_Apps.conf`: Configure autostart applications
- `UserConfigs/WindowRules.conf`: Add window-specific rules

### Understanding Window Rules
The configuration includes specific workspace assignments:
- Workspace 1: Microsoft Teams in Brave browser
- Workspace 2: General Brave browser windows and main terminal
- Workspace 3: Secondary applications and client terminals

### Theming and Wallpapers
- Wallpaper management through wallust and swww
- Current wallpaper stored in `wallpaper_effects/.wallpaper_current`
- Theme colors automatically generated from wallpaper using wallust
- GTK and Qt theming synchronized with Hyprland colors
